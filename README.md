# Graphics1-CPPSource
 This contains the source code for my graphics API produced as part of my Graphics 1 module at University. 

The compiledrelease folder contains an executable and model file that can be run to see the result of the base source code. 
The following files are not authored by myself: 
Matrix.cpp, Matrix.h, Framework.h, Framework.cpp, MD2Loader.h, MD2Loader.cpp, Bitmap.h, Bitmap.cpp.
All other work is my own unless explicity noted otherwise.
